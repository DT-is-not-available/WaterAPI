# Water API

The Water API is an alternative modding API for The Final Earth 2. It supplies a set of functions that allow you to modify the game's behavior, and go beyond the game's built-in ModTools.

The Water API is a work in progress, and is not yet complete. Some functions may undergo breaking changes in the future, and a warning will be displayed at least one version before the breaking change is made.

Experimental functions will also be marked with a warning.
